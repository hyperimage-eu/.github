<p align="center"><b>HyperImage’s main goal</b></p>

<!-- The HyperImage project aims to create an image sensing platform that revolutionizes spectral imaging technology for both short and long-range applications. With a focus on universality, speed, and affordability, the project endeavors to develop modular and adaptable photonic components and software solutions alongside high-performance spectral imaging sensors. These innovations aim to enhance resolution, widen wavelength ranges, and ultimately reduce costs, opening doors to previously inaccessible realms of imaging technology. Through a strategic focus on technical objectives, HyperImage seeks to develop modular, adaptable, and cost-effective photonic components and high-performance spectral imaging sensors. -->



The HyperImage project’s main objective is to develop a **universal, fast, and cost-effective spectral imaging platform** suitable for both long-range and short-range applications. The specific technical goals include developing innovative photonic components and high-performance spectral imaging sensors, creating advanced tunable optics, implementing modular design for automated material analysis and quality control, integrating lightweight and cost-effective spectral imaging modules into robots and vehicles, and establishing a cloud-based spectral image analysis platform. Ultimately, the project aims to validate and deploy the technology in diverse industrial use cases and establish commercialization routes and European value chains for spectral imaging systems across key market segments.
